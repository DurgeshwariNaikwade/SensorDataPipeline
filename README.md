# SensorDataPipeline

## Idea Brief
The project aims to develop a data pipeline for Emotional Support App that leverages smartphone sensor data and integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to provide real-time emotional support to users. 
The focus is on creating a seamless and resilient data engineering pipeline to collect, process, and transform smartphone sensor data, ensuring its efficient integration with the AI components of the app.
While Existing mental health apps often rely on self-reported mood tracking, while the Smart Emotional Support App will provide immediate and objective insights.
The objective is to ensure that the collected sensor data is of high quality and ready for advanced data science and AI model integration.
